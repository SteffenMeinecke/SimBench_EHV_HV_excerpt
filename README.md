# SimBench_EHV_HV_excerpt

This repository provides the applied data, i.e. power system grid data and time series profiles, to reproduce or compare with simulations of the Dissertation 'TSO-DSO Coordinated Distributed Optimizations in Grid Operations Considering System Operator Sovereignty' and the two referenced papers ['New distributed optimization method for tsodso coordinated grid operation preserving power system operator sovereignty'](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/16/12/4753) and ['Distributed optimization of smart grid assets for grid operation preserving power system operator sovereignty'](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10202774).
The [Tutorial](https://github.com/SteffenMeinecke/SimBench_EHV_HV_excerpt/blob/master/tutorials/GettingStarted.ipynb) gives advise how to apply provided data and code.
